Hi there!

I am a self-taught Python developer. I started learning Python in 2015, and web frameworks such as Django and Flask in 2019. I am currently working as a junior Python developer and aim to grow to a senior back-end or full-stack developer. 

I taught myself front-end web development and know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as front-end frameworks such as Vue.js. 

I have also learnt C++ and know the basics of the language. 

I am also the youngest certified security products technician in South Africa. I have designed solutions and have installed CCTV systems, alarm systems, electric fencing, and access control systems since the age of 13. 

I have worked in office administration and have assisted with various office administration tasks since the age of 10. I have assisted in, and have hands-on knowledge about bookkeeping, marketing, inventory management, import & export, clearing, and business management. 

I am an American Heart Association certified BLS (Basic Life Support) operator, and volunteer on the local ambulance. 

My interests include aviation, history, videography, and writing. 

I have been home-schooled my entire life and am completely self-taught.
