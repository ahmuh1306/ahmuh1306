Hi there. My name is Ahmad and I am an 18 year old living in Johannesburg, South Africa. Yes, I do live in Africa, and no, I don't ride elephants while trying to evade lions.

I have many interests and hobbies, far too many to list here.

I know C++ and Python, and I'm currently developing apps with web-frameworks like Django and Flask.

I am the youngest qualified technician of security products in South Africa. I started working in the security industry in 2015, when I was 13. Prior to that I used to help out in office administration.

I've also dabbled in cybersecurity and digital forensics.

I've been interested in aviation from a very young age, and am an aviation geek through and through.

I've been writing and maintaining different blogs since I was 7. I currently write on my blog as well as on Quora about different topics.

I'm also a tech geek and enjoy reading, writing, and watching YouTube videos about consumer electronics and security technology.

I am an EMS volunteer and have an interest in psychology.

I also enjoy videography and horse riding, and often upload GoPro footage of my horse-riding lessons on YouTube.
