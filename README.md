I’m a full-stack developer and I’m 3x AWS Certified (Certified Developer, Certified SysOps Administrator, & Certified DevOps Engineer). I currently work as a web application developer. I work across a wide variety of domains, and, amongst others, they include:

- Maintaining and improving our cloud infrastructure; modernizing our application using containerization, CI/CD, and other DevOps practices; ensuring high-availability and scalability; ensuring security practices are met; and improving cost-savings on the cloud.
- Maintaining and writing new code within our application stack; back-end development in Python using frameworks as well as implementing advanced custom functionality; front-end development in React and other JavaScript frameworks, as well as HTML/CSS; and maintaining PostgreSQL databases.
- Architecting and making engineering decisions on new product requirements; refining technical implementations; suggesting more efficient and/or user-friendly alternatives to solving the product requirement; and overseeing development of these new features.
- Project management; coordinating with various departments and stakeholders on product requirements and contributing to writing PRDs; carrying out operations tasks; and developing custom tools and scripts to help with operations and administrative tasks.
- Analytics, reporting, and data insights using BI tools like Tableau; setting up system-wide health monitoring and analytics tools; extracting data and generating insights using SQL queries; automating certain types of data extraction and reporting using Python.

I’m a problem-solver at heart; I enjoy using various technologies to piece together the most optimal solution for any problem. I love taking on new challenges and the more challenging a project is, the more fun I find it to be. I’m thorough and have a fine eye for details, but at the same time I look at the bigger picture and keep the overall scope in mind too.

I enjoy doing many things at once and I don’t like to focus only in one area for too long at a time. I thrive in dynamic environments where I’m able to work across many domains, and as a result I’m always eager to participate and play a role wherever I can. 

My near-term future goals are to grow my career and continue to explore the fields of software engineering, project management, and DevOps (just to name a few). I want to expand my programming knowledge, expand my knowledge in software architecting and engineering, and continue to improve my knowledge of cloud platforms and to get more certifications.
