I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 3x AWS Certifications (Certified Developer, Certified SysOps Administrator, & Certified DevOps Engineer). I’ve worked, and continue to work across a wide variety of domains, and amongst others, they include:

- Maintaining and improving cloud infrastructure; modernizing applications using containerization, CI/CD, and other DevOps best-practices; ensuring high-availability and scalability; ensuring security requirements are met; and improving cost-savings on the cloud.
- Maintaining and writing new code within different application stacks; back-end development in Python using frameworks as well as implementing advanced custom functionality; front-end development in React, Vue, and other JavaScript frameworks, as well as HTML/CSS; and maintaining PostgreSQL databases.
- Architecting and making engineering decisions on new product requirements; refining technical implementations; suggesting more efficient and/or user-friendly alternatives to solving the product requirement; and overseeing development of these new features.
- Project management; coordinating with various departments and stakeholders on product requirements and contributing to PRDs; carrying out operations tasks; and developing custom tools and scripts to help with operations and administrative tasks.
- Analytics, reporting, and data insights using BI tools like Tableau and monitoring tools like Datadog; setting up system-wide health monitoring and analytics tools; extracting data and generating insights using SQL queries; automating certain types of data extraction and reporting using Python and AWS Lambda.

I’m a problem-solver at heart; I enjoy using various technologies to piece together the most optimal solution for any problem. I’m thorough and have a fine eye for details, but at the same time I look at the bigger picture and keep the overall scope in mind too.

I enjoy doing many things at once and I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments where I’m able to work across many domains, and as a result I’m always eager to participate and play a role wherever I can. I’m a fast learner and I’m completely self-taught.

When I’m not programming, I enjoy going to the gym, running, playing video games, and taking pictures of pretty sunsets (some would call that “photography”, though I think it’s a stretch too far!). I’m also certified in First Aid and BLS, and I occasionally volunteer with local EMS services.
